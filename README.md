# Algorithm

1. Extract b-shells from given data
2. Check consistency among bshells and spatial resolution
3. Create ANTs template from highest b-shell
4. Apply the warps and affines obtained from previous step to compute scale maps for all b-shells
5. Template creation being complete, harmonize data for each b-shell using scale maps corresponding to that b-shell
6. Join the harmonized data in the same order of bvalues as that of the given data

Template creation and data harmonization process mentioned in steps 3-5 are described in detail at 
single shell counterpart of the program:

# Requirements for data

1. Two groups of data from- *reference* and *target* sites are required. Control (healthy) subjects should be present 
in each site.

2. The groups between the sites should be very well matched for age, sex, socio-economic status, IQ and any other 
demographic variable.

3. A minimum of 16 subjects is required from each site for proper harmonization (so a minimum of 32 subjects in total).

4. The data should be curated with the following steps prior to harmonization: 
    
    (i) axis alignment and centering
    
    (ii) signal dropped gradient removal
    
    (iii) eddy current and head motion correction
    
5. b-values in each b-shell should have similar b-values (i.e, if one site has b-value 1000, 
the other one should have in the range [900,1100]).


If your data does not satisfy these requirements, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/pnlbwh/multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/issues) or contact -

* ANTs = 2.2.0
* reisert/unring
* FSL = 5.0.11
* numpy = 1.16.2
* scipy = 1.2.1
* scikit-image = 0.15.0
* dipy = 0.16.0
* nibabel = 2.3.0

**NOTE** The above versions were used for developing the repository. However, *multi-shell-dMRIharmonization* should work on 
any advanced version. 


# Installation

## 1. Install prerequisites

You may ignore installation instruction for any software module that you have already.

### Check system architecture

    uname -a # check if 32 or 64 bit

### Python 3

Download [Miniconda Python 3.6 bash installer](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (32/64-bit based on your environment):
    
    sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b # -b flag is for license agreement

Activate the conda environment:

    source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate # should introduce '(base)' in front of each line




**NOTE** With the current design, *MATLAB Runtime Compiler* and *unringing* are not used. So, you may pass them.
    
### MATLAB Runtime Compiler

In the harmonization process, all volumes have to be resampled to a common spatial resolution. 
We have chosen bspline as the interpolation method. For better result, bspline order has been chosen to be 7. 
Since Python and ANTs provide bspline order less than or equal to 5, we have resorted to [spm package](https://github.com/spm/spm12) for this task.
Using their source codes [bspline.c](https://github.com/spm/spm12/blob/master/src/spm_bsplinc.c) and [bsplins.c](https://github.com/spm/spm12/blob/master/src/spm_bsplins.c), 
we have made a standalone executable that performs the above interpolation. Execution of the standalone executable 
requires [MATLAB Runtime Compiler](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). It is available free of charge.
Download a suitable version from the above, and install as follows:

    unzip MCR_R2017a_glnxa64_installer.zip -d MCR_R2017a_glnxa64/
    MCR_R2017a_glnxa64/install -mode silent -agreeToLicense yes -destinationFolder `pwd`/MATLAB_Runtime
    

See details about installation [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/install-the-matlab-runtime.html).

After successful installation, you should see a suggestion about editing your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
You should save the suggestion in a file `env.sh`.

    echo "/path/to/v92/runtime/glnxa64:/path/to/v92/bin/glnxa64:/path/to/v92/sys/os/glnxa64:/path/to/v92/opengl/lib/glnxa64:" > env.sh

Then, every time you run dMRIharmonization, you can just source the `env.sh` for your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be updated.

**NOTE** If you have MATLAB already installed in your system, replace `/path/to/v92` with `/path/to/Matlab/`


### unringing

    git clone https://bitbucket.org/reisert/unring.git
    cd unring/fsl
    export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`

You should be able to see the help message now:

    unring.a64 --help


**NOTE** FSL unringing executable requires Centos7 operating system.
    
    

## 2. Install pipeline

Now that you have installed the prerequisite software, you are ready to install the pipeline:

    git clone https://github.com/pnlbwh/multi-shell-dMRIharmonization.git && cd multi-shell-dMRIharmonization
    conda env create -f environment.yml    # you may comment out any existing package from environment.yml
    conda activate harmonization           # should introduce '(harmonization)' in front of each line


Alternatively, if you already have ANTs, you can continue using your python environment by directly installing 
the prerequisite libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade




## 3. Download IIT templates

dMRIharmonization toolbox is provided with a debugging capability to test how good has been the 
harmonization. For debug to work and **tests** to run, download the following data from [IIT HUMAN BRAIN ATLAS](http://www.iit.edu/~mri/IITHumanBrainAtlas.html) 
and place them in `multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/IITAtlas/` directory:

* [IITmean_FA.nii.gz](https://www.nitrc.org/frs/download.php/6898/IITmean_FA.nii.gz) 
* [IITmean_FA_skeleton.nii.gz](https://www.nitrc.org/frs/download.php/6897/IITmean_FA_skeleton.nii.gz)


## 4. Configure your environment

Make sure the following executables are in your path:

    antsMultivariateTemplateConstruction2.sh
    antsApplyTransforms
    antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh
    unring.a64
    
You can check them as follows:

    which dtifit
    
If any of them does not exist, add that to your path:

    export PATH=$PATH:/directory/of/executable
    
`conda activate harmonization` should already put the ANTs scripts in your path. Yet, you should set ANTSPATH as follows:
    
    export ANTSPATH=~/miniconda3/envs/harmonization/bin/

However, if you choose to use pre-installed ANTs scripts, you can define `ANTSPATH` according to [this](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/wiki/Compiling-ANTs-on-Linux-and-Mac-OS#set-path-and-antspath) instruction.

# Consistency checks

A few consistency checks are run to make sure provided data is eligible for harmonization.

1. First image from the reference site is used as reference for all images in reference and target sites. B-shells and 
spatial resolution are extracted from the reference image. The b-shells and spatial resolution are compared against all 
images in reference and target sites. As long as all bvalues of each image falls within +-100 of a b-shell bvalue, the 
image is considered good for harmonization.

2. Spatial resolution should match exactly. If reference image has 2x2x2 resolution, all other images should also have 
this resolution.

3. The program can automatically determine [maximum possible spherical harmonic order](https://github.com/pnlbwh/dMRIharmonization#order-of-spherical-harmonics) (`--nshm`) for each b-shell.
However, if a value is provided with `--nshm`, it is compared against the maximum possible spherical harmonic order to 
continue.


In the event of inconsistency, the program will raise and error and user should remove the case from provided lists 
and try again. 


# Varying number of gradients

A particular strength of the algorithm is its compatiblity with varying number of gradients present in images.
As long as [the number of gradients satisfies minimum required](https://github.com/pnlbwh/dMRIharmonization#order-of-spherical-harmonics) for the spherical harmonic order, determined (`--nshm -1`) 
or provided(--nshm 4), data can be harmonized.


# Sample commands

## Create template

    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/multi-shell-harmonization.py --ref_list ref_list.txt --tar_list tar_list.txt 
    --ref_name REF --tar_name TAR --template template
    --create


## Harmonize data

    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/multi-shell-harmonization.py --tar_list tar_list.txt 
    --tar_name TAR --template template
    --process
    
    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/multi-shell-harmonization.py --tar_list tar_list.txt 
    --tar_name TAR --template template
    --process --debug


## Debug

### 1. Same target list

Run together with `--create` and `--process`:

    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/multi-shell-harmonization.py --ref_list ref_list.txt --tar_list tar_list.txt 
    --ref_name REF --tar_name TAR --template template
    --create --process --debug


### 2. Different target list

In theory, you want to create a template with small number of data from each sites and then use the template to 
harmonize all of your data in the target site. Since the data for template creation and harmonization are not same, 
we don't have luxury of using `--create --process --debug` altogether. Instead, you would use `--debug` with each of 
`--create` and `--process`. The `--debug` flag creates some files that are used to obtain statistics later.
The steps are described below:

(i) Create template with `--debug` enabled:
    
    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/multi-shell-harmonization.py --ref_list ref_list.txt --tar_list tar_small_list.txt 
    --ref_name REF --tar_name TAR --template template
    --create --debug

(ii) Harmonize data with `--debug` enabled:

    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/multi-shell-harmonization.py --tar_list tar_list.txt 
    --tar_name TAR --template template
    --process --debug

(iii) Obtain statistics
    
    ## reference site ##
    
    # start with highest bvalue shell
    
    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/tests/fa_skeleton_test.py 
    -i ref_list_b3000.csv.modified -s REF 
    -t template/ --bshell_b 3000    
    
    # repeat for other non-zero bvalues
    
    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/tests/fa_skeleton_test.py 
    -i ref_list_b2000.csv.modified -s REF 
    -t template/ --bshell_b 2000
    
    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/tests/fa_skeleton_test.py 
    -i ref_list_b1000.csv.modified -s REF 
    -t template/ --bshell_b 1000

    ...
    ...
    
    
    
    ## target site before harmonization ##
    
    # again, start with highest bvalue shell, notice the absence of ".modified" at the end of -i
    
    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/tests/fa_skeleton_test.py 
    -i tar_list_b3000.csv -s TAR 
    -t template/ --bshell_b 3000
    
    # repeat for other non-zero bvalues
    
    ...
    ...
    
    
    
    ## target site after harmonization ##
    
    # once again, start with highest bvalue shell, notice the presence of ".modified.harmonized" at the end of -i
    
    multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/tests/fa_skeleton_test.py 
    -i tar_list_b3000.csv.modified.harmonized -s TAR 
    -t template/ --bshell_b 3000
    
    # repeat for other non-zero bvalues
    ...
    ...



# Tests

**TBD** Tests are incomplete as of now but will be completed soon.


## 1. pipeline

Clone single-shell dMRIharmonization pipeline and test that:
https://github.com/pnlbwh/dMRIharmonization?tab=readme-ov-file#1-pipeline


## 2. unittest
Afterwards, you may run smaller and faster unittest as follows:

    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/multi-shell-dMRIharmonization/lib/
    python -m unittest discover -v lib/tests/    



# Preprocessing

Unlike single-shell dMRIharmonization, multi-shell-dMRIharmonization does **NOT** support data preprocessing as of now. 
This is likely to change in a future release. Hence, the following arguments are present for legacy purpose but you 
should not use them.

## 1. Denoising
    
    --denoise        # turn on this flag to denoise voxel data

## 2. Bvalue mapping

    --bvalMap VALUE  # specify a bmax to scale bvalues into    

## 3. Resampling

    --resample VALUE # voxel size MxNxO to resample into


After preprocessing, the image lists are saved with `.modified` extension in the same location of provided lists, 
and used for further processing.
 



# Debugging

multi-shell-dMRIharmonization debugging is an extension of [dMRIharmonization debugging](https://github.com/pnlbwh/dMRIharmonization#debugging). In the former case, debugging is 
run at each shell separately. So, at each shell you should see nearly matching mean FA over IITmean_FA_skeleton.nii.gz 
between reference site and target site after harmonization:

    REF mean FA:  0.5217237675408243
    TAR mean FA before harmonization:  0.5072286796848892
    REF mean FA after harmonization:  0.5321998242139347


## 1. With the pipeline

`--debug` should run together with `--create` and `--process` since information from reference and target sites are used 
to obtain the above summary. 


## 2. Use separately

However, if you would like to debug separately or if your target site has more cases than the ones used in template creation, 
we provide you a way to debug manually. Firstly, make sure to harmonize data with `--debug` flag enabled. The flag will 
create diffusion measures that are used in debugging later. Then, `lib/test/fa_skeleton_test.py` script can register 
each subject FA (reference, target before harmonization, and after harmonization), to template space and then to MNI space.


    usage: fa_skeleton_test.py [-h] -i INPUT -s SITE -t TEMPLATE --bshell_b
                               BSHELL_B [--ncpu NCPU]
    
    Warps diffusion measures (FA, MD, GFA) to template space and then to MNI
    space. Finally, calculates mean FA over IITmean_FA_skeleton.nii.gz
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                            a .txt/.csv file that you used in/obtained from
                            harmonization.py having two columns for (img,mask)
                            pair. See pnlbwh/dMRIharmonization documentation for
                            more details
      -s SITE, --site SITE  site name for locating template FA and mask in
                            tempalte directory
      -t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE
                            template directory where Mean_{site}_FA.nii.gz and
                            {site}_Mask.nii.gz is located
      --bshell_b BSHELL_B   bvalue of the bshell
      --ncpu NCPU           number of cpus to use
  
  
Finally, it should print mean FA statistics like above.

`lib/test/fa_skeleton_test.py` performs two registrations:

(i) Subject to site template space

(ii) Site template to MNI space

Thus, subject data is brought to MNI space for comparison. For reference site, it is a straightforward process.
However, for target site, there are two kinds of data: given and harmonized. Since given data and harmonized data reside 
in the same space, registration is performed only once. The script is intelligent enough to exploit relevant registration 
files if registration was performed before.

In multi-shell-dMRIharmonization approach, registration is performed with highest b-shell. Obtained transform files 
are used to warp rest of the b-shells. See [Different target list](#2-different-target-list) for details.


# Caveats/Issues

## 1. Template path

`antsMultivariateTemplateConstruction2.sh`: all the images need to have unique
prefix because transform files are created in the same `--template ./template/` directory. The value of `--template` 
should have `/` at the end. The pipeline appends one if there is not, but it is good to include it when specifying.

## 2. Multi-processing

[Multi threading](#-multi-threading) requires memory and processor availability. If pipeline does not continue past 
`unringing` or `shm_coeff` computation, your machine likely ran out of memory. Reducing `--nproc` to lower number of processors (i.e. 1-4) 
or swithcing to a powerful machine should help in this regard.


## 3. X forwarding error

Standalone MATLAB executable `bspline` used for resampling in the pipeline, requires X forwarding to be properly set. 
If it is not properly set, you may notice error like below:
    
    X11 proxy: unable to connect to forwarded X server: Network error: Connection refused
    
Either of the following should fix that:
    
    ssh -X user@remotehost

or
    
    ssh user@remotehost
    unset DISPLAY
    
When using the latter option, be mindful that it may cause other programs requiring `$DISPLAY` 
in that particular terminal to malfunction.
